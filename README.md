# Automatic-Hierarchical-Attention-Neural-Network-for-Detecting-AD
a novel model proposed for linguistic based dementia detection that encompasses both the hierarchical and sequential structure of the description and detect its informative units by attention mechanism. 


The paper has been accepted by Interspeech 2019.

In our experiment, both the manual transcripts shared by DementiaBank open source dataset and ASR output with automatic punctuation are used for examining our proposed system. The experiment datasets are shared in Data/ folder. 

The order of the transcript can influence the experiment result. We set the transcript order according to the DementiaBanl_list/transcriptions_list. 

As our system is designed for binary classification, in DementiaBank, the diagnostic class for some of the participants changed during their longitudinal follow-up (mostly with MCI turning into AD), and those participants detected as MCI have been excluded for this study. In total, 222 samples from 89 HC and 255 from 168 patients with AD were selected from the original 551 files.
